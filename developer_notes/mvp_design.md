# Design of the MVP

I'll leave here the ideas I have for the initial design of the app.

## Main screen

- Small top bar with "edit profiles" button on the left, and "choose profile" button on the right.
  - Choose profile button has the name fo the profile followed by the avatar
- The rest of the screen is a vertical scrollable list of named roll components

## Named roll

- Being right handed, I'll put the roll button and the modifiers button on the right, one on top of the other with the roll one being much more prominent.
- On the left and occupying the majority of the component will be the box for the roll's result, with the name of the roll and the roll's description on top.
  - The name of the roll will be ontop of the roll's description, and the description will be the dice and modifiers that will be rolled, displayed in a fainter and smaller font.
